## Long Description

**Pipely transforms your Gmail into a powerful, lightweight CRM - without leaving your inbox.**

### Stop switching between apps

Most CRMs are overkill. You don't need another complex system to manage - you need your sales info where you already work: Gmail.

Pipely adds a smart sidebar to Gmail that lets you:
- **Create contacts** from any email with one click
- **Track deals** through a visual Kanban pipeline
- **Set reminders** that sync to Google Tasks
- **Collaborate** with your team in real-time

### Features

**Visual Pipeline**
Drag-and-drop deals through customizable stages. See your entire sales flow at a glance.

**One-Click Contacts**
Click any email to instantly create a contact. Company logos and info are auto-enriched.

**Team Dashboard**
Track team performance with leaderboards, activity feeds, and performance charts.

**Full-Page Dashboard**
Open a beautiful full-page view for pipeline management, analytics, and account views.

**Slack Integration**
Get notified in Slack when deals change stages or hit milestones.

**Your Data, Your Control**
All data is stored in YOUR Google Sheets - not our servers. You own your data completely.

### Perfect For

- Solo founders and freelancers
- Small sales teams (2-10 people)
- Consultants managing client relationships
- Anyone who lives in Gmail

### Privacy First

Pipely uses a zero-server architecture. Your CRM data stays in your Google Drive, in a spreadsheet you control. We never see or store your emails or contacts.
